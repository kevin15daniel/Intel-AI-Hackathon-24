# **Real-Time Multimodal Emotion and Thought Interpretation using Transformer-based Generative AI for Mental Wellness**

This repository contains the code and resources for a competitive hackathon project. The goal is to develop a multimodal AI system capable of reading and interpreting human thoughts and emotions in real-time while maintaining privacy, autonomy, and ethical standards. The solution leverages Transformer-based architecture and Intel oneAPI optimizations for performance and scalability.

## **Project Overview**

This project implements a transformer-based generative AI model to interpret human emotions and thoughts based on multimodal data, such as EEG signals, facial expressions, and voice features. The solution is designed to operate in real-time and adhere to strict ethical guidelines, preserving user privacy and autonomy.

## **Features**

- Real-time interpretation of multimodal data (EEG, facial features, and voice).
- Transformer-based model for accurate emotion prediction.
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving model training.
- Intel oneAPI optimizations for accelerated training and inference.
- Designed for edge deployment using Intel OpenVINO.

## **Installation**

### **Dependencies**

To set up the project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Intel TensorFlow (`intel-tensorflow`)
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Intel oneAPI Setup**

For Intel oneAPI optimizations:

```bash
pip install intel-tensorflow
```

## **Dataset**

This project simulates multimodal data inputs (EEG, facial, voice). If you have real datasets, replace the simulated data with actual EEG, facial feature, and voice datasets.

```python
# Simulating EEG, Facial, and Voice Data
num_samples = 1000
eeg_sim = np.random.randn(num_samples, 128)  # 128 EEG channels
facial_sim = np.random.randn(num_samples, 64)  # 64 facial feature points
voice_sim = np.random.randn(num_samples, 32)  # 32 voice features (e.g., pitch, tone)

# Concatenate to create multimodal input data
multimodal_data = np.concatenate([eeg_sim, facial_sim, voice_sim], axis=1)
```

## **Model Architecture**

The model is based on a Transformer architecture for multimodal emotion interpretation:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

def transformer_model(input_shape):
    inputs = layers.Input(shape=input_shape)

    # Transformer Encoder Layer
    attention_output = layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=4, key_dim=64)(inputs, inputs)
    attention_output = layers.Dropout(0.1)(attention_output)
    attention_output = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)(attention_output + inputs)

    # Feed-Forward Network
    ff_output = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(attention_output)
    ff_output = layers.Dense(128)(ff_output)
    ff_output = layers.LayerNormalization(epsilon=1e-6)(ff_output + attention_output)

    # Output layer for emotion prediction
    outputs = layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')(ff_output)  # 10 classes for emotions

    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)
    return model
```

## **Training the Model**

To train the model:

```python
history = model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)
```

## **Simulating Multimodal Data**

To simulate multimodal data for testing, use the following code:

```python
# Simulating EEG, facial, and voice data
num_samples = 1000
eeg_sim = np.random.randn(num_samples, 128)  # 128 EEG channels
facial_sim = np.random.randn(num_samples, 64)  # 64 facial feature points
voice_sim = np.random.randn(num_samples, 32)  # 32 voice features (e.g., pitch, tone)

# Concatenate data
multimodal_data = np.concatenate([eeg_sim, facial_sim, voice_sim], axis=1)
```

## **Optimization with Intel oneAPI**

Enable Intel's oneDNN for accelerated training:

```bash
pip install intel-tensorflow
```

Enable oneDNN optimizations:

```python
import os
os.environ['TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS'] = '1'
```

## **Real-Time Inference**

Simulate real-time emotion prediction:

```python
import time

def real_time_inference(new_data):
    prediction = model.predict(new_data)
    return np.argmax(prediction)

# Simulate real-time data input
for _ in range(100):
    new_data = np.random.randn(1, 224)
    result = real_time_inference(new_data)
    print("Predicted Emotion:", result)
    time.sleep(1)  # Simulate delay
```

## **Federated Learning for Privacy**

Implement federated learning to ensure privacy-preserving local training:

```python
# Split data into multiple clients
clients = [X[i::10] for i in range(10)]  # Simulating 10 clients

# Simulate local training on each client
local_models = []
for client_data in clients:
    local_model = transformer_model(input_shape=(224,))
    local_model.fit(client_data, y[:len(client_data)], epochs=5)
    local_models.append(local_model)

# Aggregating weights (Federated Averaging)
weights = [model.get_weights() for model in local_models]
new_weights = [np.mean([weight[i] for weight in weights], axis=0) for i in range(len(weights[0]))]
model.set_weights(new_weights)
```

## **Evaluation**

Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set:

```python
val_loss, val_acc = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {val_acc}")
```
